1- built two bares, Which are going to move up and down
2 - create the ball, it is a tough part, it is a turtle that has to move itself following a line
3- create the line in the middle of the screen and the sign where numbers will be located
4 - set the limits.


class Bar:
1- First I have to inherit the class Turtle.
 In the beginning, I tried to create a function "bar" but when I wanted to def UP , and DOWN,
 I couldn't due to the fact that, I needed an instance to make it works.
 So inheriting turtle, I already have the instance that is gonna be "self".

2- To use the function "listen" from Turtle, I have to use a function.
 Otherwise, this particular function doesnÂ´t work.
 So, I having already defined my instance, I can create two functions DOWN and UP.
 Here I must consider three things:
A- where does Y start? I use "ycor()"
B- Add 20 or subtract 20
C - set the new (x, y) . I use function goto(x,y)

class ball:
1- to know the angle to start moving the ball, I have calculated the hypotenuse with the aim of knowing the angle
to move the ball. a = 300, b = 400 , c = 500. proportion of movement = a/c and b/c. I have to use Pitagoras
only in the case that I want to get that the ball hit the corner.
2 - remember to use = when I want to carry out a multiplication. In this case for instance, I had to do
number *= -1.
